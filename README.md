# T-Store
this was my first project with react and for now i am leaving this project for sometime becouse of 
my other tasks there are so many bugs init but i have to left this project for now the bugs are 
1. all items will be deleted while deleting a single item with same product id (need to improve logic in backend(django api))
2. side bar data(for now the side bar data is dynamic so when a user wants to see his sidebar the sidebar will request for data on api which makes it time and load increasing stat for server)
3. non relational database(has to recreate DB becouse the api is struggling with non relational DB which increases a lots of hustels)
4.
5.
6. Bugfixs *
7. 1.all we need to save user info in localstorage or cokkies to reduce recources consumption in api side(backend)
8. as user adds a product in cart we have to gave unique id to that item and save it in user's cart as user deletes one item
9. - from cart there should be a counter to add or delete an item have to fix logic in frontend to set data
   - 2. create a relational database to manage all user data
